Super simple script I built that allows you to send money to all player bank accounts in your SQL database as well as send money to all management funds. Our mayor wanted to provide stimulus checks to people and businesses so this is what I went with. ðŸ’¸

Usage:

/stimulus player 25000

(sends 25000 to all player bank accounts)

/stimulus business 25000

(sends 25000 to all business management funds)

Wasn't able to have someone not in the admin/god group test perms, so for now I recommend only running the resource to run the command and then stop the resource after just in case my perm check isn't working right now.
